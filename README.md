# Task 5 - Wireshark Network Traffic Capture

## 🎯 Objective
Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols using Wireshark.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Windows 10
- Browsers, ping tool

## 🧪 Steps Performed
1. Installed Wireshark and captured live traffic.
2. Browsed websites and pinged a domain.
3. Filtered packets by protocol (HTTP, DNS, TCP).
4. Exported captured data to a `.pcapng` file.

## 📦 Protocols Identified
- **HTTP**: Unencrypted web traffic.
- **DNS**: Used for domain name resolution.
- **TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol for reliable data transfer.

## 📁 Files Included
- `task5_capture.pcapng` – Packet capture file
- `http_packets.png`
- `dns_packets.png`
- `tcp_packets.png`

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Packet analysis
- Protocol filtering
- TCP/IP stack basics
